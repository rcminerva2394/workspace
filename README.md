# Workspace

A work in progress task management app (Kanban board) specifically inspired by Trello.

## User stories
- User can add a board/project
- Each board has three categories: Todo, Doing, and Done
- In every category, the user can add a task card
- The user can open each task card, a modal will pop up
- When the user opens the card modal, the user can do the following:
    1) Change card title
    2) Add card description
    3) Set and delete deadline
    4) Add and delete subtasks
    5) Change status of the card to either Todo, Doing, or Done
    6) Update card status completion by clicking the checkbox deadline or due date
    7) Update subtasks status completion
    8) User can drop comments and see team members' comments as well.
- User can move the card to any category using Drag and Drop API

## Technologies

- React
- styled-components
- react-icons
- uuid
- Drag and Drop API
- Firebase

## Motivation
The goal is to practice React with Firebase integration.

## Challenges
 
  ### Visualizing the app without data
      I struggled checking how my code works at first when I didn't have sample data yet.
      What I did is I set up a sample boards array of objects data to figure out how will I tackle the operation.

  ### Firebase integration

## Learnings
   ## useContext
   ## inline arrow function for onClicks
   
## Areas for Improvement
